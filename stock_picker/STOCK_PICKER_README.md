# Project: Stock Picker 

From [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-stock-picker)

> Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

## Usage
Use the following command to run the application
- from the __root__ folder:
```bash
ruby stock_picker/stock_picker.rb 
```
OR
- from inside the __stock_picker__ folder
```bash
ruby stock_picker.rb
```

## Examples
```
For the following stocks: 17, 3, 6, 9, 15, 8, 6, 1, 10
Pick [1, 4] - for a profit of $15 - $3 = $12

For the following stocks: 32, 76, 22, 55, 22, 2, 34, 1
Pick [0, 1] - for a profit of $76 - $32 = $44

For the following stocks: 33, 23, 1, 2, 7, 8, 24, 2, 4
Pick [2, 6] - for a profit of $24 - $1 = $23
