# Project: Caesar Cipher

From [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher)

> Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.

## Usage
Use the following command to run the application
- from the __root__ folder:
```bash
ruby caesar_cipher/caesar_cipher.rb 
```
OR
- from inside the __caesar_cipher__ folder
```bash
ruby caesar_cipher.rb
```

## Examples
```
String: What a string! ===> Shift factor: 5
Cipher: Bmfy f xywnsl!

String: 1 2 3 4 5 ===> Shift factor: 15
Cipher: 6 7 8 9 0

String: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. ===> Shift factor: 2
Cipher: Vjg swkem dtqyp hqz lworu qxgt vjg ncba fqi.
```
