# Project: Bubble Sort

From [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-bubble-sort)

> Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

## Usage
Use the following command to run the application
- from the __root__ folder:
```bash
ruby bubble_sort/bubble_sort.rb
```
OR
- from inside the __bubble_sort__ folder
```bash
ruby bubble_sort.rb
```

## Examples
```
Before: [4, 3, 78, 2, 0, 2]
After:  [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 78]
Before: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
After:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Before: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
After:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
